  I'm Rajdeep Chakraborty! 
</h1>
</p>

I am a lifelong learner from India working as a Neuroscience Researcher at Centre for Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science. I am interested in translating cutting-edge discoveries into real-world applications for healthcare, creating tools that help develop quantitative models for better intervention techniques that can provide us with effective mental health care and treatments. 

My overarching goal is to dissolve the boundaries between knowledge and challenge the traditional view of knowledge being categorized and distributed according to training received from a degree. I'm a big believer in open science â€“ if we want to push the boundaries of knowledge and understand our world, we need to collaborate.
