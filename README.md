  I'm Rajdeep Chakraborty! 
</h1>
</p>

I am a lifelong learner from India with an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering and a keen interest in Neuroscience. I am fascinated by the workings of neurons and their role in running the show, and I eagerly look forward to applying my problem-solving and computational skills to this field.

My goal is to create tools that can help us better understand neuronal systems and how faults in the system can lead to neurological diseases. Developing quantitative models and integrating AI for better intervention techniques is crucial for our world, where individuals need effective mental health care and treatments.
